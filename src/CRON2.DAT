# SYNTAX:
# minute hour day month dow(0=Sun) VDM/OS2/PM FG/BG WIND/FULL[-] [{}]exec [opts]

# (with the exception of the OS/2-specific identifiers, this is a typical
# UN*X CRON file)

# A "FULL" key on a "PM" process will MAXIMIZE the window

# A minus [-] following either FULL or WIND will start the process minimized

# Since it doesn't make since to run a minimized process (FULL-/WIND-) with
# a foreground (FG) priority, a FG priority on minimized processes is
# automatically changed to BG by CRON2.

# see the CRON2.DOC file for detail explanations of the various fields:
