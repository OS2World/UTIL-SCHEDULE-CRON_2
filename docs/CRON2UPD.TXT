Archive Name: cron214.zip
Program Description: CRON/2 v1.4  A UNIX-like cron with networking extensions
Operating System: OS/2 2.x
Program Source: Author

This version replaces cron213.zip.  It adds a range operator to the CRON2.DAT
file.  Minutes/hours/days/months/dow can now span a range, using "15-18"
instead of "15,16,17,18".
This release also includes the full source code to the system, to both CRON/2
and the AT command, in IBM C/Set++ format.  As a result, this is the last
release of this system from the author.

CRON/2 extends the traditional cron behaviour by adding client/server
extensions via TCP/IP.  Each CRON/2 process can act as client, server,
or both to enable remote launching of applications on networked OS/2
systems.
